You're part of a team building the software for Electrical Vehicle (EV) charging stations in a large charging stations network.

Features are:

* Embedded Software/Firmware
This is the low-level software running directly on the hardware of the charging station. It controls the physical components such as connectors, cables, and power management systems. It ensures that the charging process starts, monitors it for any issues, and stops the charge at the appropriate time or in case of an error.

* User Interface
Touchscreen interface for the user to interact with. Used too start or stop a charge, authenticate (via a mobile app), or view charging status and pricing information.

* Authentication and Security
Happens via mobile app authentication

* Payment Processing Module
handles billing and payment transactions. can integrate with external payment gateways and support various payment methods, including credit cards, mobile payments, and subscription models.

*  Data Management
The station collects data on usage, power consumption, and operational status for billing, maintenance, and analytics

*  Remote Management and Monitoring
Updating station firmware, configuring settings, troubleshooting issues, and generating reports on usage and operational status.

*  Energy Management
helps optimize the power load, reduce operational costs, and ensure stability of the electrical grid

### Domain Glossary
- OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) communication standard used between charging stations and central management systems
- EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) Refers to the components and infrastructure that deliver electrical energy to recharge electric vehicles
- AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) Charging; AC charging is slower and typically used for residential or light commercial use. DC charging is faster
- Connector Types: Type 1 (North America, Japan), Type 2 (Europe), CCS (North America, Europe)
- V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) Technology that allows electric vehicles to communicate with the power grid
- SoC (State of Charge)
