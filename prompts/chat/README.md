## Chat prompts

These are prompts that help users kick off a chat conversation. You don't have to use a specific format, but you can 
reference knowledge snippets based on the `key` provided in the knowledge context's markdown file (Example: You can 
reference [this](/contexts/demo_crn.md) knowledge snippet by adding `{context}` to your prompt).
